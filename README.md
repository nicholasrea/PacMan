# PacMan

Here we were tasked with manipulating the DOM to create and update position of Pac-men on the screen. I took it a littler farther and added the "play-area" as well as added some CSS to clean up the page.  

## Roadmap for future

I would like to add some extra functionality to make it more interactive some how.  Ideas are still in infancy.  

## To run

You can visit here: https://nicholasrea.github.io/PacMan/
or you can Fork and load the Repo yourself.

I hope you enjoy my work.
